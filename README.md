# Product Overview

## Quick pitch
You're working out. 

Suddenly, a really great song/playlist hypes you up. 

dj heartbeat helps you find those songs. 

## How it works
- The app syncs your workout heartrate data with your Spotify listen history – each heartbeat counts towards the popularity of the workout tracks you listen to.
- dj heartbeat publishes a communal, live-updating top tracks playlist, [heart charts](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5qKGiWdS6R15dnffIt95Z4?si=096b71388f3946f8)
- The app creates a monthly workout playlist for you, aka your slaylist, and helps you build up your slaylist with tracks that make you move.
