# Product Overview

## Quick pitch
You're working out. 

Suddenly, a really great song/playlist hypes you up. 

dj heartbeat helps you find those songs. 

## How it works
- The dj heartbeat app syncs your workout heartrate data with your Spotify listen history â€“ each heartbeat counts towards the popularity of the workout tracks you listen to.
- dj heartbeat publishes a communal, live-updating top tracks playlist, [heart charts](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5qKGiWdS6R15dnffIt95Z4?si=096b71388f3946f8)
- The app creates a monthly workout playlist for you, aka your slaylist, and helps you build up your slaylist with tracks that make you move.

- Firebase is a pretty good all-in-one hosting platform; I probably won't use it for my next project

   - The dj heartbeat app is currently blocked from general audience release due to Spotify App Review. It took 3+ months to get a review, and I still have yet to hear back what specifics I can need to change in the app. The app has been reviewed 6+ times by Apple with a ~24 hour review turnaround time. 
   - I wrote this Problem/Proposed Solution doc and sent it to the Spotify team. It documents the struggles many in the developer community face while trying to ship apps using the Spotify API.
